# webappdatascience

This is a webapp in correlation to data science. The provided data set by the New York police department was used to analyze the data and display on a map where the crashes occured

An interactive webapp with maps was then created using streamlit to visualize the data at the given time and at a given point on a map. Furthermore a 3D interactive map design was also added

In conclusions the top 5 most dangerous streets of New York were then shortlisted based on the accidents occured there
